A plugin for adding MailChimp's Goal tracking code to your WordPress site.

== Description ==

= What is Goal? =

Goal is an optional campaign tracking feature available for [paid accounts](http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/how-do-mailchimp-pricing-plans-work) that lets you trigger [autoresponders](http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/how-do-i-create-an-autoresponder) based on subscriber activity from your email campaigns to your website. The Goal integration can also be used to create segments of subscribers allowing you to send targeted campaigns to your subscribers based on their Goal activity.
